Your complete digital workspace - files, applications, settings, and customizations - becomes available on any computer you encounter. Rather than being tied to a single machine or requiring installations, MiniOS Flux creates a persistent, bootable environment on a USB drive. When you boot it on any computer, your complete environment loads with all customizations and data exactly as you left them. Upon shutdown, the host computer returns to its original state while your workspace remains preserved. Released on a separate track from the main MiniOS editions (Standard, Toolbox, Ultra), MiniOS Flux is available based on Debian 10 (Buster), Debian 11 (Bullseye), and Debian 12 (Bookworm). Unlike the main editions that target current Debian releases, Flux provides stable older versions specifically optimized for legacy hardware with minimal resource requirements. With the lightweight Fluxbox window manager, it's the ideal choice for breathing new life into vintage computers while maintaining compatibility with modern systems. Whether you're working on different computers, rescuing data, or need computing freedom, MiniOS Flux provides a practical solution for portable computing.": "",
